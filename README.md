# Minigrep

This repository contains code snippets and explanations for implementing a basic command-line tool named `minigrep` in Rust. The `minigrep` tool is designed to accept command-line arguments representing a string to search for and a file path to search within.

## Accepting Command Line Arguments

To start, we create a new project named `minigrep` using Cargo:

```bash
$ cargo new minigrep
$ cd minigrep
```
The initial task is to enable minigrep to accept two command-line arguments: the search string and the file path.
